h1. Simpex â€“ Ruby library for simple ImpEx generation

The impex torture is over guys! Enjoy your hybris projects with a nice ruby api for impex generation!

Simpex will make your life easier because:

* it will remove the "csv noise" from your eyes
* let you focus on the important stuff, building relationships between your impex tables
* process any incoming format like xml, excel, csv with the power of ruby
* do basic impex validations for you before hybris does it

h2. Setup

rvm install 1.9.1
cd to directory and run _bundle install_

h2. ImpEx file generation

For now it only generates a dummy ImpEx file.
Run _rake simpex:generate_
You can find the generated file in 'tmp/'

Run _rake simpex:test_ to execute all tests

h2. Todo

* cleanup
* make generation dynamic (what are we going to use a input format? yaml? json?)
* impex macros library for creating some standard impex macros


h3. Todo Impex Factory
1. Impex factory for standard hybris types go create a bare minimum product setup that is valid in hybris


h2. Features

* we might want to use this https://github.com/aeden/activewarehouse-etl at some point for data extraction from different sources
