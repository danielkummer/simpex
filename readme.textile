h1. Simpex â€“ Ruby library for simple ImpEx generation


h2. Setup

rvm install 1.9.1
cd to directory and run _bundle install_

h2. ImpEx file generation

For now it only generates a dummy ImpEx file.
Run _rake simpex:generate_
You can find the generated file in 'tmp/impex'

h2. Todo

* cleanup
* make generation dynamic (what are we going to use a input format? yaml? json?)

h2. Features

* we might want to use this https://github.com/aeden/activewarehouse-etl at some point for data extraction from different sources
